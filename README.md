## Why NexusAgent

Most multi-agent projects are libraries: you write the orchestration, the sandbox, the review step and the UI yourself. NexusAgent is the finished product built on top of them. It is a self-hosted web and desktop app where you type a goal, an AI architect designs a whole **team** of agents for it, the team runs inside an isolated sandbox, and a human approves the sensitive steps.

- **Team, not chatbot.** A request becomes a structured team: directors, department leads and specialists, with a quality gate that sends missing work back to the right department.
- **Runs on your Mac without Docker.** The desktop app carries its own database, queue, vector store, API, Node, git and ffmpeg; agent commands run in an operating-system sandbox. A server version that runs in Docker is kept on the [`docker` branch](https://github.com/khangkaka066/Nexus-Agent/tree/docker).
- **Safe by design.** Code runs in a locked-down sandbox. Sensitive actions stop at an approval card. Every decision is written to an audit log.
- **Honest results.** A team that claims a file it never wrote fails with a clear message (media is never invented) instead of finishing as if it had delivered.
- **Bring any model.** Use your ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini or GitHub Copilot plan, an API key, any OpenAI-compatible gateway, or a local Ollama model.
- **Yours.** Self-hosted, MIT licensed, no telemetry leaves your machine.

## 🧭 The interface

The window follows the layout of modern AI code editors, so what matters is in front of you and the rest is one key away.

| Area | What it holds |
|---|---|
| **Title bar** | Sidebar toggle, back and forward, search; the breadcrumb `Project / Conversation`; a menu (copy the conversation, run log, shortcuts), the *Overview* menu and the right-panel toggle. |
| **Sidebar** | *New Conversation*, *Automations* (scheduled teammates), *Customizations* (channels, MCP, skills); **Projects** (a folder you opened, with its conversations); **Conversations**; *Settings* and your account at the foot. |
| **Conversation** | Messages, the team's live progress, approval cards, and the message box: attach (`+` or `@`), model, permissions, dictation (browsers that support it), send. |
| **Right panel** | *Review* (lines added and removed), *Files* (diff, download, accept), *Terminal* (the run's output, read-only), *Browser*, *Canvas* (the agent graph and the run log). Drag its edge to resize, or expand it to full width. |
| **Settings** | A panel over the work: General (theme, language, permissions, shortcuts), Models, Learning metrics. |

| Keys | Action |
|---|---|
| `⌘K` / `Ctrl+K` | Command palette |
| `⌘Enter` | Send the message |
| `⌘L` | Focus the message box |
| `⌘J` | Show or hide the right panel |
| `⌘I` | Open the agent run log (Canvas) |
| `⌘B` | Show or hide the sidebar |
| `⌘\` | Switch between Files and Canvas |
| `A` / `Y` / `D` | On the first approval card: allow once / always allow (scheduled tasks) / deny |

Every shortcut can be changed in **Settings → General**. On narrow windows the sidebar becomes a drawer and the right panel covers the conversation.

## ⚡ Install

You need either an AI subscription you already use (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, GitHub Copilot) or an API key.

### The desktop app (macOS, Apple Silicon, no Docker)

The installer carries the whole product: PostgreSQL, Redis, Qdrant, the API, the worker and the web app start inside the app. Agent commands find Node 22, git and ffmpeg inside the app too, so nothing has to be installed on the Mac.

```bash
python3 scripts/package/build_runtime.py mac-arm64     # downloads (sha256-pinned) and assembles the runtime
python3 scripts/package/verify_runtime.py mac-arm64    # portability audit and a smoke run from a relocated copy; must pass
pnpm --filter @nexus/desktop build:mac                 # apps/desktop/release/NexusAgent-<version>-mac-arm64.dmg
```

Open the `.dmg` and drag NexusAgent to Applications. Requirements and limits, stated plainly:

- **macOS 15 or later on Apple Silicon.** There is no Intel or Windows installer yet.
- **The `.dmg` is not signed or notarized**, so macOS asks you to confirm the first launch (right-click the app, then *Open*).
- **No browser is bundled.** The `headless-browser` command used by agents needs Chrome, Chromium, Edge or Brave to be installed, and says so when none is found.
- There is no published download yet; build it with the three commands above.

Details: [apps/desktop/README.md](apps/desktop/README.md).

### Server, Linux and Windows

There is no installer for them on `main`. A Docker deployment (any OS with Docker, and self-hosted servers with HTTPS) is kept on the [`docker` branch](https://github.com/khangkaka066/Nexus-Agent/tree/docker); a Windows build is planned and has not been started. The desktop app can also open a window onto a server you run from that branch (*Settings* in the app, an HTTPS address).

## First run

Open the app. There is no sign-up: a *Local Workspace* is created for you. Then:

1. **Settings → Models:** connect a model (see [Connect a model](#-connect-a-model)).
2. Type what you want and press Enter.
3. Open the files the team produced in the right panel, review them, accept or download them, or hand them to another team.

## ✨ What you get

| | Feature | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| 🧠 | **AI Meta-Architect** | Turns a sentence into a compilable team: agents, tasks, tools, knowledge and approval gates. |
| 🏢 | **Hierarchical teams** | Directors, department leads and specialists work in parallel waves with artifact contracts and a rework loop. |
| 💻 | **Code sandbox** | Coder and reviewer agents run code until it verifies: in the macOS app, in an operating-system sandbox with a command policy (deny, ask, allow). The Docker branch runs the code in containers instead (no network, dropped capabilities, resource limits). |
| ✅ | **Human approval** | Sensitive steps pause on an *Allow once / Always allow / Deny* card; every decision is audited. |
| 🗂️ | **Task history** | Every task and its conversation is saved; reopen it, delete it, or retry it. |
| 🩺 | **Readable failures** | The failure card names the department and agent that stopped and the sanitised error. Retry only the failed step (finished departments are kept) or the whole team. |
| 🔗 | **Team-to-team handoff** | Attach files from an earlier task with `@`, or press *Hand off* to start a marketing or analytics team from the results. |
| 🔌 | **Model freedom** | Subscription connectors, API keys, OpenRouter, Groq, Mistral, DeepSeek, Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM and any OpenAI-compatible gateway; switch model per task. |
| 📚 | **RAG + MCP** | Upload documents into a knowledge base (Qdrant), or connect MCP servers and OpenAPI tools. |
| 🔁 | **Time travel** | Rewind to any checkpoint, edit state, resume, or fork two branches and compare them. |
| 🧬 | **Learning & evolution** | Agents share vetted lessons under a scope firewall; teams diagnose bottlenecks and propose new generations, with rollback. |
| 💸 | **FinOps** | Per-model cost tracking, plan usage recorded at $0, and cheaper-model suggestions once quality is verified. |
| 🛡️ | **Multi-tenant security** | PostgreSQL row-level security on every table, RBAC, scoped API keys, encrypted credentials. |
| 🌐 | **English and Vietnamese** | Switch the interface language at any time. |

## 🎬 Agent studios

Ask for a product and NexusAgent builds a whole studio. Pick the size: *compact*, *by department* (~19 agents) or *full studio*.

| Studio | Agents | Produces |
|---|---:|---|
| **Feature Film & Series Production** | 50 | Screenplay, storyboard and previs, design and casting, camera, sound, VFX, budget and schedule, animatic, distribution plan. |
| **Full Game Development** | 49 | Design docs, art direction, code, build checks, playable preview. |
| **Marketing & Social Publishing** | 41 | Strategy, copy, per-channel packages for TikTok, YouTube and Facebook, content calendar, KPI tracker, launch checklist. |
| **Analytics & Optimization** | 34 | Measurement plan, KPI baseline from the data you attach, experiment plan, forecast, HTML report. |
| **Full-Stack SaaS & AI Software Factory** | 32 | Architecture, backend and frontend code, tests, security review, release notes. |
| **Cinematic Video & Documentary** | 26 | Research, script, storyboard, voice and sound plan, subtitles, contact sheet. |

Plus four small templates: Data Science & Financial Analyst, Software QA & Security Auditor, Market Research & Content Engine, and an Executive Inbox & Operations teammate.

The runtime is assembled from plugins: connections, model access, checkpoints, tools, and the sandbox supervisor with its providers (local macOS, Docker, cloud) are independent plugins mounted by a small kernel (`python -m nexus_plugins dump-config` prints what a process boots). See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the rules.

|---|---|
| `apps/web` | Next.js interface |
| `apps/api` | FastAPI control plane, auth, billing, workers |
| `apps/desktop` | Electron shell with local folder mounting |
| `packages/agent-runtime` | Flow compiler, crews, NexusGen bridge, time travel, consensus, plugin kernel |
| `packages/learning-transfer` | Knowledge capsules, scope firewall, self-healing prompts |
| `packages/model-gateway` | Providers, subscription connectors, pricing, FinOps |
| `packages/computer-sandbox` | Local (macOS), Docker and cloud sandbox providers |

## 🔌 Connect a model

Open **Settings → Models**.

| Source | How |
|---|---|
| **GitHub Copilot** | *Sign in with GitHub* and enter the 8-character code. |
| **ChatGPT Plus / Pro / Team** | `codex login`, copy `~/.codex/auth.json` into `data/subscriptions/codex/` (or paste it), and give the URL of your subscription bridge. |
| **Claude Pro / Max** | `claude setup-token` and paste the token, or copy `~/.claude/.credentials.json` into `data/subscriptions/claude/`. |
| **Gemini Advanced / Code Assist** | Copy `~/.gemini/oauth_creds.json` into `data/subscriptions/gemini/`, or paste a bridge token. |
| **API key or gateway** | **Nexus Harness**: enter the API URL and key of any OpenAI-compatible provider; models are discovered automatically. OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, DeepSeek and Ollama have their own cards. |

Use the model selector in the message box to switch model per task, including any model id you type. Plan usage is recorded at $0 per token; no price table is needed.

> Plan tokens work only on endpoints that understand them (for example a bridge such as CLIProxyAPI), and providers may limit using plan tokens outside their own apps. Check the terms of your plan.

## 🖥️ Desktop app

[apps/desktop](apps/desktop/README.md) is an Electron shell around the same interface. Besides the self-contained install above it adds: open a real project folder (`⌘/Ctrl+O`) that appears under **Projects**, review changes as diffs and accept them into your files, a global shortcut (`⌘/Ctrl+Shift+Space`) for quick tasks, and system notifications. `pnpm --filter @nexus/desktop dev` runs it from source. Only the macOS Apple Silicon `.dmg` has been built and verified; the Windows and Linux targets are configured but untested, and the Windows build would still need a sandbox and a verifier of its own.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

| Group | Variables |
|---|---|
| Security | `NEXUS_SECRET_KEY`, `NEXUS_API_KEY_PEPPER`, `NEXUS_CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY_BASE64` |
| Models | `NEXUS_*_API_KEY` (optional server keys), `NEXUS_MODEL_RATES_JSON` (optional cost estimates) |
| Plans | `NEXUS_CODEX_HOME`, `NEXUS_CLAUDE_HOME`, `NEXUS_GEMINI_HOME`, `NEXUS_COPILOT_HOME` |
| Plugins | `NEXUS_PLUGINS_FILE`, `NEXUS_PLUGIN_PATCHES` |
| Access | `NEXUS_LOCAL_MODE`, `NEXUS_PUBLIC_SIGNUP_ENABLED`, `NEXUS_REGISTRATION_TOKEN`, `NEXUS_CORS_ORIGINS` |
| Sandbox | `NEXUS_COMPUTER_ROOT`, `NEXUS_SANDBOX_PROVIDER` |

Everything is listed in [.env.example](.env.example). Call the API with a scoped key: `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer nx-sk-<KEY>" http://localhost:8000/api/v1/workflows`.

## 🧭 Roadmap and honest limits

- **Posting to TikTok, Facebook and YouTube is not wired yet.** The marketing and film teams write publish-ready packages and checklists and stop at your approval; channel cards store a token and check connectivity only.
- **Video generation** depends on your provider offering a video API. Agents describe, plan and assemble media; they do not invent files.
- The interface has a single local workspace for now; the multi-workspace switcher is planned (the backend already isolates workspaces).
- **The right panel is honest about what it is.** *Terminal* shows the run's output and is not an interactive shell; *Browser* is a sandboxed frame (a site that refuses framing opens in your system browser); the permission preset is read-only and describes the sandbox policy. Dictation needs a browser with speech recognition and is not offered in the desktop app.
- The new shell is dark-first; the light theme is not fully restyled yet.
- With an unusual model gateway the architect may pick model names the gateway does not have (the task then stops with a *model not found* error). Choose a model you have connected, or give the full provider-qualified id.
- Agents can still misjudge their own work. Failed claims are caught and reported, and every run can be retried, but review important output yourself.
- Planned: node handlers as plugins, per-workspace plugin configuration, Windows and Linux desktop verification.
